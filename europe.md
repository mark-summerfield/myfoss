### The EU's Cyber Resilience Act (CRA)

Our commercial software is for sale or resale in the US and most
countries _outside Europe_. We explain why below.

The EU's Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) is due to become law in 2024 and allows
a three year grace period for compliance.

We believe that it is impossible for a small business such as ours to
achieve compliance with the Act.

In view of this we have stopped selling our software into any country which
adopts the CRA or a local equivalent. This includes all EU and EEA
countries, EU candidate countries, and some others with access to the single
market such as Switzerland and the UK (where we are based).

##### Our Opinion on the CRA

It appears to us that the CRA was written by one of the big
consultancies to generate as much consulting compliance revenue as
possible, and at the same time squeezing out small businesses that can
neither comply on their own nor afford to hire a consulting company to
do the compliance for them.

The CRA lacks proper provision for small businesses and for open source
software developers, exposing them to considerable legal risk. For open
source developers it means that something that some of them do for fun
and for interest and to share their expertise becomes something for
which they might be suedâ€”something that open source licences
specifically protect against, but which the CRA overrides. And for small
businesses, the burden of the extra bureaucracy and the additional risks
of predatory legal action make selling into Europe extremely
unattractive.

Overall, the CRA is bad news for European software innovation and will
ensure that Europe lags even further behind the US and elsewhere in
years to come.
