**Note that In view of the EUâ€™s Cyber Resilience Act and an abundance of caution, I
have withdrawn all my free software (see
[EU CRA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyber_Resilience_Act#Criticism)).**


This is the main website for my [Free Open Source Software](https://mark-summerfield.github.io/myfoss/).

I have some applications and some libraries in various languages.
